  <ul id="blog-posts" class="posts">
    <p>Thanks for coming to my corner of the internet!</p>
    <p>I grew up in Pakistan where I did my undergrad in EE at <a href="https://lums.edu.pk">LUMS</a>.
        After finishing my undergrad in 2012, I came to Michigan for <a href="https://umdearborn.edu">grad school</a>,
        where I got a masters in EE. In 2014, I moved to Boston for work and have
        been in the area ever since.
    <p>Here in the Boston area, I work at <a href="https://www.mathworks.com">MathWorks</a> as a software engineer
        on the compilers team, specifically improving the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder.html">Simulink Coder</a>
        and <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/embedded-coder.html">Embedded Coder</a> products. </p>
    <p>I like working on challenging problems in the compilers and backend systems area
        that involve infrastructure, performance, and scalability.</p>

    <p>Thanks for coming to my corner of the internet!</p>
    <p>I grew up in Pakistan where I did my undergrad in EE at <a href="https://lums.edu.pk">LUMS</a>.
        After finishing my undergrad in 2012, I came to Michigan for <a href="https://umdearborn.edu">grad school</a>,
        where I got a masters in EE. In 2014, I moved to Boston and worked for <a href="https://www.mathworks.com">MathWorks</a>
        in their compilers team, specifically developing features for the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder.html">Simulink Coder</a>
        and <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/embedded-coder.html">Embedded Coder</a> products.

        In 2018, I joined <a href="https://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> in the SF Bay Area. Here, I work on the backend web services for the LinkedIn feed.
